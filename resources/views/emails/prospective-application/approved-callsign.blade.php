            Hey Ranger Applicant {{$application->first_name}} {{$application->last_name}},
        </p>

        <p>
            The Ranger Handle Wranglers have been hard at work sorting through stacks of radio callsigns, and they've
            found one of yours that works.
        </p>

        <h3>You shall hereby be known as: {{$application->approved_handle}}. Congratulations!</h3>

        <p>
            This is the handle you will be using in training, on the BRC Ranger radios, and as a way to identify
            yourself in person while Rangering. As a courtesy to the hard working Handle Wranglers, please do not
            request changes to your handle between now and the conclusion of this yearâ€™s event.
        </p>

        <p>
            Our next step is to load your information into the Ranger scheduling tool called <i>The Secret
                Clubhouse.</i>
            Look for an email from the Clubhouse asking you to create a password for your account. Please note there
            will be a delay of up to two weeks before you receive an email from the Clubhouse. Thank you for your
            patience.
        </p>
        <p>
            We will also subscribe you to the Ranger Applicant News email group, which we use for all of our important
            communication to Ranger Applicants.
        </p>

        <h3>What can you do now?</h3>

            <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hUqrJwdMG6XB5nk7Eh8nY2GH4uvAFTppmCKCmfidIvQ/edit">HERE</a>.
            You won't be able to upload one just yet, but you'll need to do so before you can sign up for training.

            Read the most recent version of the Ranger Manual and Burn Perimeter Briefing

        </p>

                Note: You are required to complete the Online Course prior to signing up for In Person Training.
            </b>
            In Person Training Sign-Ups will not be visible to you in the Clubhouse until the Online Course is
            completed.

        <p>
            Practice your radio skills until they are second nature. Reviewing the ART of Radio (link in the right
            sidebar of <a href="https://rangers.burningman.org">https://rangers.burningman.org</a>) will help. Also
            watch your email for information on off-playa virtual radio practice opportunities, coming your way sometime
            soon.
