    Hey {{$application->first_name}} {{$application->last_name}},

    <p>
        Thanks for considering the Rangers! Weâ€™ve reviewed your application.
    </p>

    <p>
        When asked whether you meet the minimum qualifications to volunteer with the Rangers, you responded that you
        are NOT eighteen years of age or older.
    </p>
    <p>
        Unfortunately, you do not meet the qualifications. In order to apply to volunteer
        with the Black Rock Rangers, <b style="color: #c90000;">you must be at least eighteen years old</b> and:
    </p>
    <b>&mdash; EITHER &mdash;</b>
    <ul>
        <li>
            have attended Burning Man at least twice with one of those years being in the last ten years.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>OR:</b> have attended Burning Man at least once in the last ten years, as well as have participated
            as a Ranger at a sanctioned Burning Man regional event at least once in the last five years (or will have by
            April 5th of this year).
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Thanks again for your interest in the Rangers! Please re-apply when you can meet our qualifications. In the
        meantime, there are lots of great ways to volunteer at Burning Man that don't have these requirements:<br>
