            <b>2. Upload a BMID photo.</b><br>
            Before you can sign up for training you'll need to upload a photo for your Burning Man ID badge.
            <b>Before you select/take your photo</b>, please read

            Log in to the Ranger Secret Clubhouse and click "Upload a New Photo" (on the
            right side of the dashboard view on desktop, at the top on mobile &amp; smaller screen tablets).
            Follow the instructions. Note that it may take 2-3 days for your BMID photo to be approved
            (the reviewers can be pretty picky). If you encounter any problems, please email our fantastic BMID
            experts at <a href="mailto:ranger-vc-list@burningman.org">ranger-vc-list@burningman.org</a>.

                read the most recent version of the Ranger Manual
            </a>.
            Once you've read the manual, sign back into the Clubhouse and click the "Go To Online Course" button under
            the "Read the Ranger Manual & Complete The Online Course" dashboard step. This course is estimated to take
            90 minutes-ish, and you can save
            your progress and return at any time.

            <b>4. Sign up for In-Person Training.</b><br>
            Once you have completed the other steps, sign up for an In-Person Training, in the Clubhouse.
            Locations and dates for In-Person Trainings will be available in the Clubhouse. Rangers train
            every year, so you will need to go to a training this year, even if you went to
            one last year. Please ensure you have signed up by June 15th.
